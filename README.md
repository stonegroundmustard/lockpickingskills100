# The Davinci Code

## Description

I am creating a password generator between 8 and 128 alphanumeric and special characters for added security on otherwise normal and guessable passwords. I'm motivated by this challenge to learn JavaScript and develop these specific skills for variables, functions, buttons and statements. I solved numerous debugging issues having to do with for loops and else if statements.
